# Setting the Starting Volume

You can define the starting volume for when the user initially presses play.  
To do this, you need to add a "volume" key to your initialization JSON.  This
value is any number between 0 and 100. Think of this as a percentage.
If you want the volume percentage at 35%, set this value equal to 35.

```javascript
	Amplitude.init({
		"songs": [
			{
				"name": "Song Name 1",
				"artist": "Artist Name",
				"album": "Album Name",
				"url": "/song/url.mp3",
				"cover_art_url": "/cover/art/url.jpg"
			},
			{
				"name": "Song Name 2",
				"artist": "Artist Name",
				"album": "Album Name",
				"url": "/song/url.mp3",
				"cover_art_url": "/cover/art/url.jpg"
			},
			{
				"name": "Song Name 3",
				"artist": "Artist Name",
				"album": "Album Name",
				"url": "/song/url.mp3",
				"cover_art_url": "/cover/art/url.jpg"
			}
		],
		"volume": 35
	});
```
